# Magekyo Manga Reader

This is simple manga reader that allows search, download and view manga from popular websites.

The main effort was to create proof of concept to make reading as more simple as possible since most
of manga readers are really cool, but I wanted to have better reading experience.

Unfortunately because most of manga volumes do not not fit to Android Market terms of service the app was
removed from the market some time ago so I decided to open source it to make it available for everyone.

I welcome pull requests for this project, new feature requests and any of your feedback!
